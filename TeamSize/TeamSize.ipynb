    "Considerations of team size in a conversation with ChatGPT: https://chatgpt.com/c/66db5e28-0fbc-8005-8867-0a3691f6f5f7\n",
    "\n",
    "This conversation was from sometime in early 2024 IIRC.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal was to consider the probability of fielding a Mythic team of 20 on any given night given roster sizes from 25-28. A quick consideration of this is often wrong, as the math is intuitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Towards the end of the conversation we get into considering attendance rates for individuals instead of using a distribution. The compute time needed to do this for a team of 28 was too high for ChatGPT's servers at the time, so I had to run it locally. This is the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "I recently needed to re-run this so I figured I'd toss it into this repo."
